# Han Zhang's Blog

## Blog structure

Each blog is a folder under `content/post`. It will contain an `index.md`, which has some meta info that will be rendered. Also it can specify a cover image, which I use AI to create. If the code is minimal, I put them under the same folder for image generation or minimal experiments.

## Cheatsheet

### New post

```shell
hugo new post/<BLOG_NAME>
```

### Local preview

```shell
hugo serve
```
